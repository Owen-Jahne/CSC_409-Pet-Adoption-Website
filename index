<h1> Summary </h1>
<p1> To begin our project, we decided to divide the project into several different subtasks. The first task was creating the SQLite database 
by uploading the .sqlite file containing our dataset to the DB Browser. This made it possible to run queries so that we could filter through our data.
We had everyone try using DB Brower to sort of see how it worked. Once everyone had a look at that, we began splitting up our tasks. </p1>

<p2> Andre took the lead on the .php file with Mark. Gustavo was helping out with the styles sheet along with researching how to get the table to diplay all of
the information by linking the .sqlite file. Max took the lead on the styles sheet and creating a custom background for the pages. Owen took the lead on creating
the summary page of the website.</p2>
